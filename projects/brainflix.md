"Cloud computing" plays a vital role in the creation of software products and services. It's also one of the most highly sought-after skills in the tech industry.

In fact, most of the projects on this site will require cloud interaction of some sortâ€”particularly with AWS's serverless products.

## Getting Started

> To use AWS in these projects, we'll need to set up an account, the CLI, and the SDK.

### Create an account

If you don't already have an account then [sign up here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start).
